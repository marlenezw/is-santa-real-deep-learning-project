# Is Santa Real?

This is an image classification project using a deep learning model in Python. For this we will be using the Keras library to build a convolutional neural network. This will be a friendly introduction to neural networks and deep learning for python programmers. In the prroject we will be training our model to recognise if a picture contains Santa or not.
